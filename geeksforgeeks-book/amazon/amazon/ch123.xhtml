<h1>Amazon Interview | Set 116 (On-Campus)</h1>
<p><strong>Round 1:-</strong><br /> 20 MCQâ€™s(Majority from OS and Java, C++, 1 aptitude)<br /> 2 coding questions.<span id="more-130764"></span></p>
<p>1. Given an array, find the maximum sum that can be formed from the array such that no two adjacent elements are taken into consideration..<br /> for ex:- 1,2,3,5 should return 7.<br /> 2. Print Vertical axis sum of the given binary tree.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:-</strong><br /> Group Coding Round<br /> 36 people made it to the next round. 2 questions were asked<br /> 1. Given an array which initially increases and then decreases, search for an element in the array.<br /> 2. Merge â€˜kâ€™ sorted arrays.</p>
<p><strong><br /> Round 3:-</strong><br /> Technical interview<br /> 18 people were selected for the next round and they asked me 2 questions<br /> 1. Given an infinitely growing sorted array which initially consists of 0â€™s and then 1â€™s upto infinity. Find the transition point where 0 changes to 1 effectively.<br /> 2. Given a binary search tree, make 2 separate trees such that difference between the sum of elements between them is minimum.(After some time he gave me a hint which helped me solve the problem).</p>
<p><strong>Round 4:-</strong><br /> Technical Interview<br /> 1. Some basic OS related questions<br /> 2. Implement a data structure which would perform insertion, deletion, search and randomize operation with minimum time complexity.<br /> We discussed a lot of data structures and I settled with a data structure (Hashtable with DLL). But he gave me clues and improvised my solution.<br /> 3. Implement a Queue using 2 stacks. Optimise your implementation</p>
<p>(They didnâ€™t ask me to code in this round. They just checked how efficiently I approached it )</p>
<p><strong>Round 5:-</strong><br /> Technical interview<br /> I think this is the bar raiser round. We are aware of the game show in which a contestant will think of a famous personality and the host will try to find the personality within a finite set of questions. I was asked to design a system which would implement the same. He asked me to write a code to return the first question (like the deciding factor on which the elements will be further partioned) so that I can find the celebritry in minimum no. of questions.<br /> I think they were checking your approach, ideas and patience in this round. Whatever solution I gave he never seemed to be satisfied. Be confident in your approach and donâ€™t ever give up.</p>
