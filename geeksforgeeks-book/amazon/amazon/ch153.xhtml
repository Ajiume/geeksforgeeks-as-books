<h1>First round</h1>
<p><strong>Question 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem statement:</strong> Given an Amazon reviews paragraph containing several words, find the minimum distance between two given words.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Following is a hypothetical paragraph in an amazon review –</p>
<p>“Amazon is the best company to work for. The amazon is a beautiful forest.”</p>
<p>Find the minimum distance between ‘Amazon’ and ‘The’</p>
<p><strong>Given:</strong> You are given the position of each word in the paragraph. Meaning, you know that word ‘Amazon’ occurs at positions 1 and 10, and ‘The’ occurs at 3 and 9. You do not have to parse the paragraph to gather this info.</p>
<p><strong>Sub questions :</strong><br /> *Which data structure will you use to store the given info?<br /> *Compute the minimum distance in the most efficient way.<br /> *Give a working code for the same.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2</strong><br /> <strong>Problem statement:</strong> In a binary tree, a chain can be defined as sum of length of the left node series, right node series, and 1. Find the length of longest chain in the tree.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Refer to the image given below –</p>
<p>Chain length of node 1 = 3 + 2 + 1 = {count of 3 corresponds to node 2 , node 4, node 8 ; count of 2 corresponds to node 3, node 7 ; 1 corresponds to node 1 itself}<br /> Similarly, chain length of node 2 = 2 + 1 + 1<br /> The max chain length here is of node 1 which is 5. So, the output should be 5.<br /> <a href="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/tree1.png"><img src="media/file17.png" alt="tree" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Sub questions:</strong><br /> * Provide a solution, optimize it, give a working code or pseudo code or an algorithm for the same.</p>
