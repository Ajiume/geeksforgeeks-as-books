<h1>Amazon Interview | Set 123 (On-Campus for Internship)</h1>
<p><strong>Online round:</strong> In this round there were 20 MCQâ€™s to solve and 2 coding question.<span id="more-131017"></span> Of the 20MCQâ€™s a couple of questions were on Quantitative aptitude, relationships, OS, DBMS, Data structures etc. there was negative marking for every wrong answer so I attempted only 15 for which I was sure.</p>
<p>Q1- find the first non repeating character in a string.</p>
<p>Q2- given a binary tree where each node has some weight. You have to return the max weight in the binary tree.</p>
<p>Maxweight = value of root node + value in its left subtree and right subtree.</p>
<pre><code>Ex  - 2
   /   \
  -1    3
Output = 4 </code></pre>
<p><strong>1st round(50 mins):</strong><br /> Q1. Reverse link list in k chunks<br /> <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-list-in-groups-of-given-size/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-list-in-groups-of-given-size/</a><br /> Interviewer was first interested in approach then he asked me to code.</p>
<p>Q2. Spiral order traversal of binary tree<br /> <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/level-order-traversal-in-spiral-form/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/level-order-traversal-in-spiral-form/</a><br /> I first told him 2 stack approach but he asked me to do without stack .Then I gave him a solution using one queue and one stack and he finally asked me to code both the approaches.</p>
<p>Q3. Longest palindromic substring<br /> <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-palindromic-substring-set-2/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-palindromic-substring-set-2/</a><br /> I first used DP but he asked me to do O(1) space complexity. I was unable to do so.</p>
<p><strong>2nd round :</strong><br /> Q1. Connect sibling pointer in a binary tree<br /> <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level/</a><br /> <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level-with-o1-extra-space/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level-with-o1-extra-space/</a></p>
<p>Q2. Push ,pop and min operations in O(1)<br /> <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-and-implement-special-stack-data-structure/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-and-implement-special-stack-data-structure/</a><br /> He asked me to do middle operation also and then he asked me to code 2nd problem.<br /> <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-and-implement-special-stack-data-structure/">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-stack-with-find-middle-operation/</a></p>
<p>Q3. Given n point in a 2d plane ,find k distant nodes from the origin.<br /> I told him min heap approach and he was satisfied.</p>
<p>Q4. Problem statement was very long but it was topological sorting.<br /> <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/</a><br /> I used adjacency list representation, he asked me why<br /> And finally asked me to code it.</p>
<p>Overall it was a very nice experience interviewing with them.</p>
<p><strong>Some tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Never give up</li>
<li>Donâ€™t start with coding ,first explain the approach.</li>
<li>Be honest</li>
