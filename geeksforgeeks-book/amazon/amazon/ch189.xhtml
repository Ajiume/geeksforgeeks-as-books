<h1>Amazon Interview Experience | Set 182 (For SDET 1)</h1>
<p><strong>Round 1: (Written Test)</strong><br /> 1. Given a sorted array construct a Balanced Binary Search Tree.<br /> 2. Given a linked list, find whether linked list is palindrome or not without using any extra space.<span id="more-134574"></span><br /> 3. Given set of strings find longest common prefix. If no common prefix present print null<br /> Example: {abcd, abbd, abdy, az}<br /> Answer: a</p>
<p><strong>Round 2: (F2F â€“ Problem Solving)</strong><br /> 1. Given sorted array of unique elements. Find an element which is having value equal to its index.<br /> {-4,-2,2,4,6,9}<br /> Ans: 2<br /> 2. Given a brick of size 1 x 4, how many ways you can construct a wall of size N x 4</p>
<p><strong>Round 3: (F2F â€“ Data structures and Algorithms)</strong><br /> 1. Give a binary tree, print all the nodes in spiral order with constant space<br /> 2. Give a binary tree and a light source fixed placed right side of the tree. Print all the nodes where the light directly falls.<br /> <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/amazon-interview-experience-set-182-for-sdet-1/treelightsourceproblem/"><img src="media/file22.png" alt="TreeLightSourceProblem" /></a><br /> 3. Merge two sorted linked lists without using extra space</p>
<p><strong>Round 4: (Telephonic â€“ Hiring Manager from Seatle â€“ All Questions on Testing and Projects)</strong><br /> 1. Tell me about yourself<br /> 2. Roles and responsibilities of your current role<br /> 3. How do you test a search box<br /> 4. Did you ever have a fight with developer over a defect? If you had how did you solved ?<br /> 5.

<p><strong>Round 6: (F2F â€“Bar Raiser)</strong><br /> 1. Tell me about yourself<br /> 2. Why Amazon<br /> 3. Hardest bug you found<br /> 4. Given an array of integers. Write a program to find interval with largest producing maximum sum. You should print sum as well as first and last index of the interval.<br /> 5. Your strengths<br /> 6. Your weakness</p>
<p><strong>Useful sources for Technical Preparation:</strong><br /> 1. GeeksForGeeks<br /> 2. Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy by NarasimhaKarumanchi<br /> 3. Data Strucutures videos by Prof Naveen Garg from IIT Delhi</p>
<p>Use Cracking the Coding Interview book by McDowell Lakmen for behavioral as well as technical questions.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong><br /> 1. Think loud in front of interviewer.<br /> 2. Never keep quiet during interview<br /> 3. Prepare well on the projects which you are currently working on.<br /> 4.
