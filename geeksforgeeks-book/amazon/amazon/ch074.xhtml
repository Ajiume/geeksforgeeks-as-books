<p><strong>2nd Round (Face-to-Face)</strong><br /> <strong>1.</strong> Write a program to get all list of nodes without siblings in Binary tree<br /> <strong>2.</strong> How do you implement ‘Car service center’ application to achieve Reliability, Scalable and Consistent in distributed environment.</p>
<p><strong>3rd Round (Face-to-Face)</strong><br /> <strong>1.</strong> Some behavioural Questions<br /> <strong>2.</strong> Core java Q: Why do we need equals method ? Can we check equality using hashcode method. Difference b/w them ?.<br /> <strong>3.</strong> Get all nodes K distance away from leaf nodes. I could able to tell him my idea, but I couldn’t able to come up with program with in given time.</p>
<p><strong>4th Round (Face-to-Face)</strong><br /> <strong>1.</strong> Specific questions on current working project.<br /> <strong>2.</strong> Implement my own Connection pooling<br /> <strong>3.</strong> Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes. Initially I told him solution with help of Stack , then he asked without using extra space, With his clue, I could able to tell him using recursive logic to solve it.<br /> Inputs: 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8-&gt;NULL and k = 3<br /> Output: 3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;6-&gt;5-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;7-&gt;NULL.</p>
