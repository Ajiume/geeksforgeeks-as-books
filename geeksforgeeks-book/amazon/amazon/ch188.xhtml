<h1>Amazon Interview Experience | Set 181 (For SDE 1)</h1>
<p>Recently I was interviewed by Amazon for SDE 1, here is my Experience. Hope this will help others:<span id="more-134537"></span></p>
<p><strong>Written Round :</strong><br /> there where 3 coding question , out of which 2 where DS related and 3 rd one was Problem solving<br /> 1. Count no of words in given string .<br /> 2. Find first non repeating character in a stream of characters<br /> 3. related to slot machine and its working</p>
<p>Interviews<br /> <strong>F2F 1.</strong><br /> 1. firstly some non technical questions where there , such as<br />      tell me about yourself ,<br />      Why Amazon etc<br /> 2. followed by 2 coding questions<br />      1. Given a sorted dictionary of alien language , find order of characters.<br />      2. find minimum number of characters needed to be added to the end of a string to make it palindrome.</p>
<p><strong>F2F 2.</strong><br /> was a senior guy ,<br /> 1.started with discussion on previous interview questions , as I had used DP in second question so a brief discussion on DP , tried to test me that does I really know the concept of DP.<br /> 2. asked few puzzles , One should be prepared for some out of box questions as they want to check the thought process . even they change puzzles and try to get different solutions. Think loud always.</p>
<p><strong>F2F 3.</strong><br /> was also a senior guy,<br /> 1. Started with general induction and asked about till then my interview experience and related stuff.<br /> 2. Simple Matrix multiplication problem ,with only 2 double pointer are given , we need to check sizes of both matrix , multiplication feasibility and then do multiplication .<br /> 3. Design Question from DataBase point of view , asked about table structure for the problem and had a good discussion on it , concept such as normalisation was discussed .</p>
<p><strong>Telephonic 4th</strong><br /> He was a very senior guy from different team ,<br /> 1. Started with general introduction followed by many Behavioural hr questions .<br /> 2. Followed by Design Question, a feature of Outlook<br /> A Server receives meeting objects from multiple senders. Meeting object contains meeting time, sent time, recipient(s), sender id,etc. When recipient comes and checks the server, he/she should get requests based on meeting time and not based on sent time. Many discussions on space complexity and time complexity.?Eg:</p>
<p>12 PM From: A To: B,C,D meeting time: 4 PM meeting Id: 1</p>
<p>12.30 PM from: A To C,D meeting time : 2 PM meeting Id:2</p>
<p>1:PM From B To: C meeting time: 1.30PM meeting Id:3</p>
<p>When C requests the server, C should get ID3 as 1st, ID2 as 2nd and ID1 as 3rd meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Small set of Suggestions :</strong><br /> 1. Practice writing code using pen and paper .<br /> 2. Try to be interactive as they are very much interested in candidate’s thought process , think loud , be confident .<br /> 3. Firstly explain the logic and when interviewer is satisfied then start coding .<br /> 4. Have few questions prepared for the interviewer as it shows interest of candidate towards the company .Do proper home work about the company.</p>
