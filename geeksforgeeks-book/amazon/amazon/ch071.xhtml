<h1>Amazon Interview | Set 62 (For SDE-1)</h1>
<p>I recently went through the Amazon interview process for the post of SDE-1. <span id="more-126076"></span></p>
<p><strong>Round 1 (Written)</strong><br /> 1. Given an array, output an array where every index conains nearest greatest element to that element on right side.<br /> 2. Program to convert sorted array to Binary Search Tree<br /> 3. Find first non-repeating character in String<br /> ex: geeksforgeeks: f<br /> geeksforgeeksFirst:o</p>
<p><strong>Round 2 (F2F)</strong><br /> 1. Given linked list as a-x-b-y-c-z<br /> output it as a-b-c-z-y-x<br /> that is reverse alternate element and append to end of list</p>
<p>2. Output nearest number greater than given number such that output is palindrome<br /> ex: 121:131<br /> 900:909<br /> 99:101</p>
<p><strong>Round 3 (F2F)</strong><br /> 1. Vertical Sum in Tree( I told him I know the solution, he proceeded further)<br /> 2. Given stream of Strings find top 5 words with maximum frequency or count<br /> 3. Given 2 nodes in Binary Tree find distance between them</p>
<p><strong>Round 4 (F2F with hiring manager)</strong><br /> 1. Projects done so far, HR questions<br /> 2. Design Linkedin and find till 2nd level connections and path between 2 connection<br /> for ex: if A is friend of B which is friend of C<br /> print between A and C A-B-C<br /> 3. Programming language: Java<br /> About synchronisation, serialization, transient and volatile keyword, Singleton Class</p>
<p><strong>Round 5 (Bar Raiser)</strong><br /> 1. Count Inversion in array that is if i a[j]<br /> Told the solution nlogn of divide and conquer. He asked another solution, then told by inserting in BST and whenever node goes to left side then adding 1 and number of children on right side . We have to keep track of count of right subtree in every node</p>
<p><strong>Round 6 (F2F)</strong><br /> 1. HR questions (Why leaving company, projects, SWOT)<br /> 2. Program to check for mirror tree<br /> 3. Data Structure so that push, pop, getmin, getmax O(1) (using 3 stacks)<br /> 4. Data Structure so that push, pop, pop min, pop max<br /> Told Solution till O(logn) by using min heap, max heap with pointers to doubly linked list nodes</p>
