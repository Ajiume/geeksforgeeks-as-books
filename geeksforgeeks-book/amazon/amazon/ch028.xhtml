<h1>Amazon Interview | Set 19</h1>
<p>I recently had a set of interviews with Amazon.com and listing below the questions. The day had around 15-20 of us at their office and the whole process took close to 12 hrs.<span id="more-113895"></span></p>
<p>Hope, people can reap benefit from it. <img src="media/file4.gif" alt=":)" /></p>
<p><strong>1st Round:Â </strong>Online Written round.</p>
<p>a. Determine if a matrix is a cross-matrix.</p>
<p>Â  Â  A cross-matrix is a one in which all theÂ diagonalÂ elements are same and not repeated anywhere else.</p>
<p>b. Print the level-order in reverse order, i.e. from Bottom to top.</p>
<p>c. One more easy question, which IÂ don’tÂ remember now.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2nd Round:</strong>Â F2F- Developer</p>
<p>a. Kadane’s Algo.</p>
<p>However, it was hidden behind a good problem set.</p>
<p>Interviewer wanted to identify whether I can recognize the same.</p>
<p>I did not remember it instantly but was able to prove it by solving.</p>
<p></p>
<p>b. Linked-list intersection point.</p>
<p>Again, had to decipher the above from a different problem set.</p>
<p>[A tree with only parent pointer, how to find LCA?]<br /> Was able to easily identify the same and we quickly moved onto other things.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3rd Round :</strong>Â Hiring Manager</p>
<p>a. Design a stack which can perform findMax in O(1).</p>
<p>Had read the answer once in some book and duly told him have heard it.</p>
<p>He verified and we moved on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>b. Set of stocks for each day have been given. Need to find the days on which I buy and sell share to earn max profit, alongwith finding the max profit.</p>
<p>Had to write the code, which I was able to do well.</p>
<p>He was impressed and I felt I had a good chance.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4th Round</strong>Â : Developer</p>
<p>a. Find top k searched elements from aÂ continuousÂ stream of data.</p>
<p>I remember we needed to use Min Heap but his constraint was using a continuousÂ stream.</p>
<p>Finally was able to do it with his help.</p>
<p>b. Some design question based upon his team’s problems.</p>
<p>Had to use a queue and a hashmap to solve it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He was very muchÂ interestedÂ in whether I could identify the complexities correctly.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>5th Round</strong>Â : Manager – Different Team</p>
<p>a. Given a linked-list and 2 integers k &amp; m. Reverse the linked-list till k elements and then traverse till m elements and repeat.</p>
<p>Write production quality code.</p>
<p>I am not sure what happened and why I fell off on such an easy question, but you just can do something like that in the last round.</p>
<p></p>
<p>b. An array of elements have been given. Find for each element, first max element to its right.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Was able to do it well, however lost it on complexity analysis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>c. Boundary traversal of a tree. Write the code.</p>
<p>Wrote the code, however he was not able to check the same as took a lot of time.</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title=""><code> </code></pre>
<p>Before this round, I had good hope of getting selected, butÂ no oneÂ can give such a bad last interview and get selected and hence after 2 weeks got a rejection mail.</p>
