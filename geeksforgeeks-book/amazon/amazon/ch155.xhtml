What you will do if you have conflict with your manager.<br /> 4. Guys this question brainf**cked me.The question was based on â€œ20 question gameâ€?.I never played this game. This was the actual question-<br /> <a href="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/amazon2.png"><img src="media/file20.png" alt="amazon2" /></a><br /> Given a set of words like Modi,MJ,Obama,Hillary Clinton.We need to create a intelligent computer game so that it will popup minimum questions to find out the answer the player thought. For ex- If give user choices to chose any word from Modi,MJ,Obama,Hillary Clinton.Now computer will show popup from any of the tags.Like if user chose Modi then in this case computer should ask minimum questions to find out what will be the guess.so in this case computer only askd â€œPMâ€? tag and computer will show the popup â€œModiâ€?.</p>
