<h1>Amazon Interview experience | Set 127 (For Internship)</h1>
<p><span>Amazon visited our campus for summer internship. I prepared from Amazon Interview Sets which were pretty helpful!</span></p>
<p><span id="more-131371"></span></p>
<p><span>Here is my experience :</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>DAY 1</span></p>
<p><span>They had an online aptitude test on day 1. It was 90 minutes: 20 MCQs + 2 coding questions (choice between C/C++/Java for coding). MCQs were based on DSA, OS, and Math. They were apparently difficult. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Two Coding Questions :</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1. </span><a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-possible-words-phone-digits/"><span>Keypad problem</span></a><span> – Little difficult problem on backtracking.</span></p>
<p><span>2. </span><a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-of-triangles-possible/"><span>Given an array, find the count of impossible triangle</span></a></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Day 2:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Surprise aptitude test</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>2 coding questions 60 mins. </span></p>
<p><span>Questions involved DSA and strongly based on optimising the code:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Given a linked list, reverse K nodes in it </span></p>
<p><span> eg :- 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;NULL , k = 3</span></p>
<p><span> 3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;5-&gt;4 </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>2. Search for an element in an array which has elements whoâ€™s values are first increasing and then decreasing. (Use modified binary search)</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>2 One-on-one Interview rounds, both technical.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Try giving THE most optimal algorithm which satisfies edge cases too.</span></p>
<p><span>I was told to write the code on the paper. </span></p>
<p><span>Questions asked to me were:</span></p>
<p><span><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>First interview round</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1. </span><a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/to-find-smallest-and-second-smallest-element-in-an-array/"><span>Find the second largest element in an array.</span></a></p>
<p><span>2. Given a sorted array which can have repeated elements, find the occurrence of an element. (Most optimal solution is O(logn) – Using binary search to find start and end occurrence)</span></p>
<p><span>3. Make a data structure and implement an algorithm to print all the files in a directory. (the root directory can have sub-directories too.)</span></p>
<p><span> I used an n-ary tree and BFS to print files. It can also be done using Stack.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>Second interview round</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1. He asked some question about my CV</span></p>
<p><span>2. </span><a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-matrix-diagonally/"><span>Print a matrix diagonally.</span></a></p>
<p><span>3. DFS of binary tree, n-ary tree.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Then he asked some question from other subjects.</span></p>
<p><span> OS – Scheduling </span><br /> <span> DBMS – Normalization, Transaction</span><br /> <span> OOPS – Abstraction</span></p>
