<p>The First Round Was very Standard, first we had to open its Hiring test portal, in which it had 20 MCQ and 2 coding questions, which we had to complete in 1:30 Hrs.<br /> MCQ:</p>
<ul>
<li>It had question from OS, DBMS, Algorithm, Infix, postfix</li>
<li>OS basically from scheduling, and process management in UNIX</li>
<li>DBMS questions some simple query in my SQL</li>
<li>questions asking Complexity of some give Algo. number of swaps in Bubble sort, best technique to sort partial sorted list etc</li>
<li>finding output of prefix expression, given Postfix finding prefix of BST etc</li>
<li>full form of LDAP, qustions including privileges of User, kernel in UNIX etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Coding:<br /> 1: given 3 Numbers in Linked list, we had to return the Linked List of representing sum of all three, covering all base and condition of addition.</p>
<pre><code>  eg:   for addition of
           234+993+1 :
     input Linked Lists are: 4-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;NULL, 3-&gt;9-&gt;NULL, 1-&gt;NULL
     output linked list :  8-&gt;2-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;NULL </code></pre>
<p>2: Simple and same Vertical traversal of a BST as given in Geeksforgeeks.org</p>
