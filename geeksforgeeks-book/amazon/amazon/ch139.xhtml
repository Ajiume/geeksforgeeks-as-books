<h1>Amazon interview Experience | Set 132 (For SDE Intern)</h1>
<p><strong>Online Round :(Duration – 90 minutes)</strong></p>
<p>20 MCQs to solve and 2 coding questions. 20MCQs were on <strong><span>Algorithms,Data Structures, C Output</span></strong>, Quantitative Aptitude, etc.<span id="more-131677"></span><br /> Coding questions were of 10 marks each.<br /> MCQâ€™s had negative marking.<br /> Correct : +1<br /> Wrong : -0.25</p>
<p><strong>Q1</strong>- Given an array of numbers, arrange them in an <span><strong>alternate fashion</strong></span> such that every number is followed by a number of opposite sign. Also the <span><strong>order was to be maintained.</strong> </span>If the count of negative numbers is more keep the extra at last in array and same for positive numbers.</p>
<pre><code>Example :
Input: -3 -2 6 0 7 -1 -8
Output: -3 6 -2 0 -1 7 -8</code></pre>
<p><strong>Q2</strong>- String of characters as arranged in a cellphone i.e.<br /> 1- NULL<br /> 2-a,b,c<br /> 3-d,e,f<br /> 4-g,h,i<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> 9-w,x,y,z<br /> 0-NULL</p>
<p>Print all <span><strong>combinations for given number of digits</strong></span>(k) in <span><strong>lexicographical order</strong></span> .<br /> Constraint : 1&lt;=k&lt;4<br /> For Example : Input = 234<br /> Output : adg adh adi aeg aeh aei afg afh afi bdg bdh bdi beg beh bei bfg bfh bfi cdg cdh cdi ceg che dei cfg cfh cfi</p>
<p><strong>Round 1 F2F :(Duration – 1 hr)</strong></p>
<p>Introduce Yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Q1</strong>- Design a <span><strong>shuffle function</strong> </span>which would play songs randomly in your device (unique song_id) and code it.<br /> After i gave him a solution with hash function , he asked me to improve the algorithm such that once a song is played it should be played only when all the other songs are played,<br /> Solutionâ€™s Complexity : Space – O(n) , Time – O(1) ; nâ€”&gt; number of songs<br /> After that he asked me to improve my solution and do it without using extra space.<br /> Solutionâ€™s Complexity : Space – O(1) , Time – O(n) ; nâ€”&gt;number of songs<br /> Hint : Maintain indices and once a song is played shift it in range of played songs index.<br /> After that i was asked about each part of the hash function and how i came up with that.</p>
<p><strong>Q2</strong>- <span><strong>Add two linked lists</strong></span>. And code it.</p>
<pre><code>Input : 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;NULL
        8-&gt;2-&gt;NULL
Output : 1-&gt;3-&gt;1-&gt;6-&gt;NULL</code></pre>
<p>First he asked to do it <span><strong>without recursion</strong> </span>and then <span><strong>with recursion</strong></span>.We also talked about the <span><strong>problem</strong> </span>we face if we store the value of the linked list in an integer or long if the number of digits were above certain limits in the non-recursive function.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2 F2F :(Duration – 1 hr)</strong></p>
<p>Introduce Yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Q1</strong> â€“ Find the <span><strong>largest subtree which is binary search tree in a given Binary Tree</strong></span>. Then to optimise it and then asked me to code it.</p>
<p><strong>Q2</strong> â€“ Given a linked list with a next pointer and an arbitrary pointer pointing to any node in the list , <span><strong>copy the linked list</strong></span>.</p>
<p>After i gave him a solution which changed the links of the initial linked list, he asked me to do without changing the links.</p>
<p>So i gave him a O(n^2) solution . He asked me to give another way or optimise my solution.He helped me to figure out the solution.</p>
<p>Hint – Hash map.</p>
<p>The interviewers were really helping and supporting and were more interested in seeing the efforts you make and the way you get to the logic.They help throughout by giving hints.</p>
<p>Thank You geeksforgeeks for helping me out.</p>
<p>Best of luck .</p>
