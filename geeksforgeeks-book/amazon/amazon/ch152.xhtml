<h1>Amazon Interview Experience | Set 145 (Off-Campus)</h1>
<p>I have been working with Amazon for last 2 years and 4 months. Here, is my interview experience when I was the interviewee:<span id="more-132463"></span></p>
<p>Off Campus Drive (DCE) – 2012</p>
<p><strong>Written test:</strong><br /> 1-&gt; WAP to merge two linked lists like:</p>
<pre><code>      list1: 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4
      list2: 5-&gt;6-&gt;7
      o/p list: 1-&gt;5-&gt;2-&gt;6-&gt;3-&gt;7-&gt;4</code></pre>
<p>2-&gt; Given two trees T1 and T2. WAP to check whether T1 is a subtree of T2 or T2 is a subtree of T1</p>
<p>3-&gt; WAP to find maximum sum sub-matrix from a give matrix.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1:</strong></p>
<p>1-&gt;You are given a sorted but rotated array of integer like: 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5<br /> You have to search an element…<br /> I answered with an O(logn) solution…<br /> then he asked me to write the code…</p>
<p>2-&gt;What is the diameter of a tree?<br /> I answered…<br /> then he asked me to write the complete code…</p>
<p>3-&gt;He asked me a design problem “you have to design a class “DeckofCards”…with 2 operations: 1:Shuffle 2:Pick”<br /> Pick would pick a random card from the deck and Shuffle will shuffle the cards and give you back the deck of cards.<br /> I answered with 2 options 1.LinkedList 2:Array…then there was a discussion around 15 mins over both the solutions…</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:(I guess it was the bar-raiser round)</strong></p>
<p>1-&gt; My Introduction and My Projects (all 1 by 1 except the last)</p>
<p>2-&gt; How to compute all possible solution of A^3+B^3=C^3, where A,B,C belongs to (0 to N)?<br /> Write code…</p>
<p>3-&gt; How to compute A^n where n Write code...</p>
<p>4-&gt; A tough “matrix with a mask” problem…I took around 20 mins to solve it.</p>
<p>5-&gt; Why Amazon, what is scalability and questions from my answers…like how would you manage millions of requests…</p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong></p>
<p>1-&gt; You r given a matrix of 0s and 1s. WAP that check if an element is 0 or not and places zeros to all the col and row of that element.</p>
<pre><code>       eg: i/p:    1 1 1 1       o/p    :  1 1 0 1
                   1 1 0 1                 0 0 0 0
                   1 1 1 1                 1 1 0 1
                   1 1 1 1                 1 1 0 1</code></pre>
<p>2-&gt; How to find a largest palindrome from a given string? Write code….</p>
<p>3-&gt; How many Data Structures you have implemented by yourself?</p>
<p>4-&gt; Given some words(written in lexical order) of some unknown language…You have to find lexical ordering of all the alphabets…<br /> Like in english lexical ordering is A B C…Z</p>
<p><strong>Round 4</strong><br /> Forth round was just related to my projects and subjects…(Paging, Deadlock, Trashing, JAVA and C, Synchronization, etc) + 1 final algo question “How to find all anagrams in a dictionary” Solution was in O(1)..</p>
