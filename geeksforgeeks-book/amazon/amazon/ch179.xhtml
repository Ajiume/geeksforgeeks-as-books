<h1>Amazon Interview Experience | Set 171</h1>
<p>Hi, I recently got an offer from Amazon, here is my interview experience:<span id="more-133685"></span></p>
<p><strong>Round-1: (Written)</strong></p>
<p>Q-1: Search element in infinite sorted array.</p>
<p>Q-2: Fine LCA (lowest common ancestor) of given two nodes in Binary Tree. Handle all corner cases like one element exists and other not. <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree-set-1/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree-set-1/</a></p>
<p>Q-3: Find next greater number with same digits. Handle corner cases. <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-next-greater-number-set-digits/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-next-greater-number-set-digits/</a></p>
<p><strong>Round-2: (F2F)</strong><br /> Q-1 : <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-stream-of-integers-running-integers/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-stream-of-integers-running-integers/</a></p>
<p>Discussed corner cases. Proper code was required.</p>
<p>Q-2 : <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clone-binary-tree-random-pointers/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clone-binary-tree-random-pointers/</a></p>
<p>Discussed different approaches. Proper code was required.</p>
<p><strong>Round -3 (F2F)</strong></p>
<p>Q-1: <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-32-word-break-problem/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-32-word-break-problem/</a></p>
<p>I donâ€™t have Idea about problem initially then he asked to make some test cases, some tricky one. I gave recursive algorithm then, after this came on DP solution but time doesnâ€™t permit so moved to second question. Code was required.</p>
<p>Q-2: Given inference rules and some input tokens find all tokens which can be possible with given rules. Example :</p>
<p>Rules :<br /> AÃ B<br /> BÃ D<br /> CÃ E<br /> DÃ F</p>
<p>Input Tokens :<br /> 1. A,C then all A,B,C,D,E,F are possible.<br /> 2. A then A,B,D,F are possible.<br /> Ask me what data structure you will use, how processing will happen. Pseudo code was required.</p>
<p><strong>Round -4 (F2F)</strong><br /> Long discussion on my current work. Biggest challenge and how you solve it. Technology challenge.</p>
<p>Q-1: Suppose you receive 10 million mails in 10 seconds. How will you process them and find whatis problem to receive these many mails. Discussed different approaches.</p>
<p>Q-2: longest palindromic substring of given string. I gave DP solution, he ask me donâ€™t use DP. Proper code was required.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-palindrome-substring-set-1/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-palindrome-substring-set-1/</a></p>
<p><strong>Round-5 ( Telephonic)</strong></p>
<p>Long discussion on my current work again, Challenges faced. What you did when some mess-up happens and deadline is very strict. Conflict with manager.</p>
<p>Q-1 : Outlook:<br /> A server receives meeting objects from multiple senders. Meeting object contains meeting time, sent time, recipient(s), sender id,etc. When recipient comes and checks the server, he/she should get requests based on meeting time and not based on sent time. Many discussions on space complexity and time complexity.<br /> Eg:</p>
<pre><code>12 PM      From: A  To: B,C,D   meeting time: 4 PM   meeting Id: 1

12.30 PM   from: A  To C,D      meeting time : 2 PM   meeting Id:2

1:PM       From B   To: C       meeting time: 1.30PM  meeting Id:3</code></pre>
<p>When C requests the server, C should get ID3 as 1st, ID2 as 2nd and ID1 as 3rd meeting.</p>
<p>Q-2 : <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/add-greater-values-every-node-given-bst/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/add-greater-values-every-node-given-bst/</a></p>
<p>I gave solution using temp array, then he ask me to do in constant space in single traversal. Condition donâ€™t use pointer for sum or call me reference. Proper code was required.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Be yourself . Practice writing code on paper. Never give up.</p>
<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org. See your article appearing on the GeeksforGeeks main page and help other Geeks.</p>
<p>Thanks Geeksforgeeks for providing very good platform to well prepare. A knowledge repository J</p>
