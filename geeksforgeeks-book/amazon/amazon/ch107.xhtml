<h1>Amazon Interview | Set 100 (On-Campus)</h1>
<p>First of all many many thanks to geeksforgeeks for such a great guidance. Amazon visited our campus for recruitment. Here is my interview experience. <span id="more-130452"></span></p>
<p><strong>Round -1</strong><br /> 20 MCQs (C ,Aptitude,DS,DBMS,Networks)<br /> 2 programming questions were asked-<br /> 1.) Print all root to leaf path of a given binary tree whose path sum is a given value k.<br /> Note: tree was given in the form of array (so no need to create the tree).<br /> Input: Input contains two space separated integers K and L followed by 2^L-1 space separated values<br /> Output: All root to leaf path which has a path sum = k.<br /> Sample Test case :<br /> Input :<br /> 40 4 10 11 13 # 15 28 6 # # 8 4 # 9 11 #<br /> Output:<br /> 10 11 15 4<br /> 10 13 6 11</p>
<p>2.) Given few sets of intervals print out the the entire intervals without overlapping, if they overlap then combine them into one.<br /> Sample test case:</p>
<pre><code>Input :    (5,7) (1 , 6) (2 ,4) (10 ,14) (8,9)
Output :   (1,7) (8,9) (10,14) </code></pre>
<p><strong>Group fly Round:</strong><br /> 2 ques were asked in this round. We were asked to write code on paper very fast.(It was an elimination round.</p>
<p>1.) Given a binary tree as below</p>
<pre><code>                               A
                    /    \
                   B      C
                   /    \
                  D      E
                     /     /   \
                    F    G      H </code></pre>
<p>Convert the structure of the tree like a left aligned tree whose each node contains a down pointer and a right pointer and looks like the below tree..</p>
<pre><code>            A
            |
            B â C
            |
            DâE
            |
            FâG â H</code></pre>
<p>2.)The arrival and departure time of trains are given. Find the minimum number of platforms to accommodate all the trains.</p>
<pre><code>Eg.     Arrival     Departure
        7       11
        8       10
        13      14
        4       6
Output:   2 </code></pre>
<p><strong>Round 2. (F2F)</strong><br /> 1. An array is given in which elements are first monotonically increasing and then decreasing.<br /> Search an element in the array. Working code was asked which takes care of all the edge cases. Also asked the time complexity of the code.</p>
<p>2. Implement queue using 2 stacks .<br /> What would be the complexity of enqueue and dequeue operation. I told him O(1) for enqueue and O(n) for dequeue. Then he asked to optimize it. Then he asked the Average case time complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Round 3 (F2F)</strong><br /> 1. You are given a graph. Write a function to remove all the cycles. Means after the function call the graph must be converted into a connected acyclic graph(tree).<br /> 2. What happens when u send an email to someone.<br /> 3. What is socket ? What is port?<br /> 4. Which protocol is secure for mail transfer? Which protocol is used by Gmail?<br /> 5. What is the port number of SMTP?<br /> 6. Suppose u open notepad and type something and save it what would happen.<br /> 7. What is static member?<br /> 8. What is singleton class??<br /> 9. If a class has all its members as static would it be a singleton class? Compare them.<br /> 10. What is process scheduling? How does it happen? What are various queues maintained by the system? (Where does the scheduler process run ??- This ques was asked in 2nd round of DE Shaw &amp; co).<br /> 11. Suppose various process are waiting for a particular resource? What is this situation called? How does the system overcome from this problem?<br /> 12. What the various ways of process communication?<br /> 13. What is thrashing ?How to overcome from it?</p>
<p><strong>Round: 4.)(HR + Technical)</strong><br /> 1. Tell me something about yourself<br /> 2. A long discussion on project. Brief description. How can you improve it?What changes will make if I ask you to develop it again? Give example of implementation of various oops concept in your project.<br /> 3. What is multithreading? Then he said that there are situations where there is no need of multithreading.eg- if I want to add two numbers then no point of using multithreading.So give an example where you can actually implement multithreading. (ANS â€“ Fibonacci number)<br /> 4. Some behavioral questions like-<br /> What are you good at?<br /> What are you proud of?<br /> What are the things you want to change in yourself?etc.</p>
<p>5. Various oops concept like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance , etc. with example.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong><br /> â€¢ Donâ€™t start writing the code immediately.<br /> â€¢ First tell him the approach .<br /> â€¢ Take care of all the edge cases.<br /> â€¢ Many times interview may give you hints so make the interview interactive.<br /> â€¢ Very Important – Donâ€™t focus just on a particular subject like only DS.<br /> â€¢ More or less give time to everything.<br /> â€¢ Study the concepts of OOPS and OS properly.<br /> â€¢ Have a basic Idea of DBMS and Computer Networks also.</p>
<p>All the best.</p>
