<h1>Amazon Interview | Set 16</h1>
<p>I recently appeared for amazon which came to our campus. Here is my experience. <span id="more-28643"></span></p>
<p><strong>Shortlisting Round.</strong><br /> There were 20 MCQ and 2 programming questions. Each correct answer carried 1 mark and -0.25 for a wrong answer. Programming questions were:</p>
<p>a. Given a number with the number of digits in the range of 10-50, find the next higher permutation of the number. If such a number doesn’t exist, return -1.</p>
<p>b. Given an array of strings, you need to find the longest running sequence of a character among all possible permutations of the strings in the array.<br /> INPUT:<br /> ab<br /> ba<br /> aac<br /> OUTPUT:<br /> a,3</p>
<p>Then there were 4 rounds of interview.</p>
<p><strong>T1</strong><br /> a. Given link list segregate odd elements first and even elements afterwards.</p>
<p>b. Given a BST of memory sizes. Find best fit for a memory block of size M.</p>
<p><strong>T2.</strong><br /> a. Given 2 sorted arrays of size m and n+m(with n elements) , merge<br /> them into the latter..<br /> b. Given a character array find the first element that repeats itself.</p>
<p><strong>T3.</strong><br /> a. Given a binary tree connect all nodes in a level through link list.</p>
<p>b. Some question related to share market which boiled down to find maximum difference between two elements such that second element appears after the first one.</p>
<p>c. What is thrashing ?</p>
<p>d. Real world application of heaps?</p>
<p>e. Minimum spanning tree and topological sort .</p>
<p><strong>T4.</strong><br /> Around half an hour HR then<br /> Given a function node* inplacemergesort(node* n1, node* n2) which takes 2 linked lists as input and performs in-place merge sort and returns the final list. How will you test it and make sure it does what it claims.</p>
<p>I was hired <img src="media/file4.gif" alt=":)" /> .<br /> The interviewers were very friendly, patient and looked for optimal solution to each question .</p>
