<h1>Amazon interview Experience | Set 129 (For SDE 1 Off-Campus)</h1>
<p>In the recent past, I attended interview with Amazon. Here is my interview experience. <span id="more-131551"></span></p>
<p><strong>Written Round: 1.5 hours</strong><br /> 1. Given an array of integers, replace each element with the next immediate greater element.<br /> 2. Given a linked list, reverse each 3 nodes.<br /> 3. Given a tree, print all the nodes which are K distance from the leaf nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Face to Face Interview 1 (Data structures and Algorithms)</strong><br /> 1. Given a source string and destination string, Find the minimum number of edits (operations) required to convert one string into another. At the end of each operation, the resultant string should be a dictionary word.</p>
<p>2. Given an array of integers where each element represents the max number of steps that can be made forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element).<br /> 3. Given the coordinates of billion stars in the sky, find the closest 100 stars from our current position (0,0).</p>
<p><strong>Face to Face Interview 2 (Problem solving)</strong><br /> 1. Given a binary tree, write code to check if it is a binary search tree.<br /> 2. Given a binary tree and two nodes, write code to find the common parent for the 2 nodes.<br /> Given the below tree, and nodes 18 and 21.</p>
<pre><code>         10
     5       15
  2    3   12   18

How is the query processed?<br /> 12. What is Primary Key, Foreign Key ?<br /> 13. Should Foreign key needs to be primary key of another table ?<br /> 14. What is index ? How it is implemented ?<br /> 15. How is the data stored in the database ?<br /> 16. Why doesnâ€™t Java support Multiple Inheritance ?<br /> 17. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Multiple inheritance ?<br /> 18. Tell us about the design patterns you know.<br /> 19. Do you know about Factory Design pattern ?<br /> 20. Write a simple class which implements Singleton design pattern. Applications of<br /> singleton design pattern. Why donâ€™t we declare the class itself as static class ? Why<br /> donâ€™t we declare all the members as static ?</p>
<p><strong><br /> Face to Face Interview 4 (Hiring Manager)</strong><br /> Tell me about yourself.<br /> Why career change ? Why Amazon ?<br /> 1. Discussion about my current project, I am working on. Questions related to schema design, how can we improve it ? How to make the application scalable if the operations and data (session creation &amp; data) are going to be increased 100 times. When do we need big data ?<br /> 2. What is your biggest achievement ?<br /> 3. What do you expect from your manager and team members ?<br /> 4. Given billion numbers in a file, get the top 10 numbers from it.<br /> 5. Write code to implement Hashmap in Java. It should accept any datatype and also objects.<br /> 6. Provide a high level class design for cab management system. Finding available car anytime and booking it, customers, orders, etc.</p>
<p>F<strong>ace to Face Interview 5 (Bar raiser)</strong><br /> Tell me about yourself.<br /> Why career change ? Why Amazon ?<br /> 1. What is your biggest achievement ?<br /> 2. Discussion about my project. Discussion about the tasks which I have done.<br /> 3. Tell me about a situation where you had a conflict with your manager and how you resolved it ?<br /> 4. What is the biggest bug have you made ?<br /> 5. Have you developed any tool, which is used by your colleagues ?<br /> 6. Is there any task which you feel, that you could have done better in your project ?<br /> 7. Have you suggested any ideas and improvements to your project, beyond your call of duty ?<br /> 8. Given a binary tree, write code to get the vertical sum of all the columns in the tree, with minimum space complexity. After I told a solution with Hash, he asked me to come up with a solution without using hash and code it.</p>
<p><strong>Face to Face Interview 6 (Data structures)</strong><br /> 1. Given a binary tree, how would you serialize it, store in a file and then recreates it again from the file ?<br /> 2. Given a dataset below,</p>
<pre><code>    Name  Score  Rank
      A    50     1
      B    40     2
      C    30     3
      D    20     4
      E    10     5. </code></pre>
