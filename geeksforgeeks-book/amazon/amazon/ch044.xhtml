<h1>Amazon Interview | Set 36</h1>
<p>1 round (20 MCQ + 2 coding question)<br /> 3 face to face round, 1 telephonic interview.<span id="more-121605"></span></p>
<p>1st coding question<br /> —————————–<br /> Find the diameter of the tree.</p>
<p>2nd coding question<br /> —————————–<br /> check the validity of sudoku.</p>
<p><strong>1st face to face Round</strong><br /> ————————————-<br /> Qs-1) In a binary tree, a complete path is defined as a path from root to a leaf. The sum of all nodes on that path is defined as the sum of that path. Given a number K, we have to remove (prune the tree) nodes from the tree which lie on a path having sum less than K. A node can be part of multiple paths. So we have to delete it only in case when all paths from it have sum less than K.<br /> I was able to solve the problem with bottom up approach, and able to write a working code of it.</p>
<p>Q-2) Given an array of positive numbers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no 2 numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the array. So 3 2 7 10 should return 13 (sum of 3 and 10) or 3 2 5 10 7 should return 15 (sum of 3, 5 and 7).<br /> I was able to give him a DP solution with a Parent array which stores thee index of the parent of every element,i hd put -1 for the first element,at the end I backtrack the array to find the all the elements.</p>
<p><strong>2nd face to face Round</strong><br /> ————————————-</p>
<p>After some personal questions, the interviewer asked 1 coding question</p>
<p>Q-1)<br /> n1 pairs of “{} ” brackets<br /> n2 pairs of “[] ” brackets<br /> n3 pairs of “() ” brackets<br /> I have to find the all valid combinations of all the pairs. I have to write the working code of it.<br /> I gave him the solution with recursion and stack.</p>
<p><strong>3rd face to face round</strong><br /> ————————————-</p>
<p>Interviewer asked some basics Questions on Design patterns, OOPS and OS,after the big Discussions of all the Questions he asked 1 coding questions.</p>
<p>1st Question<br /> ————<br /> There is a string, in which all the spaces are removed, we have to find the original string with the help of a machine which takes input a word checks that it is valid or not.</p>
<p><strong>Telephonic Interview</strong><br /> ————————————-</p>
<p>The Interviewer asked to give a brief idea about my project.<br /> After some questions on my Project, the interviewer asked 2 coding question</p>
<p>Q-1) tree to doubly link list. O(n) and in-place solution is required.</p>
<p>Q-2) A array of N elements, we have to replace all the elements with nearest greater which is present on the right side of that elements. O(n) is required.</p>
<p>After 2 days, they inform me that I am selected for the job. <img src="media/file4.gif" alt=":)" /></p>
