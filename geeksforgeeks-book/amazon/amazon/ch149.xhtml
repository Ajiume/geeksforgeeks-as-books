<h1>Amazon interview Experience | Set 142 (Off-Campus for SDE-1)</h1>
<p><strong>Round 1: Telephonic</strong><br /> Q1. Implement some functionalities of Minesweeper like connected component search and game termination check etc.<span id="more-132339"></span></p>
<p>Q2. Linked list random pointer question.<br /> <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-linked-list-with-next-and-arbit-pointer/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-linked-list-with-next-and-arbit-pointer/</a></p>
<p>Q3. Given a matrix of 0s and 1s find the row that contains maximum number of 1s.</p>
<p>Q4. Given a node in a binary tree, find all the nodes which are at distance K from it. Root node is also given.</p>
<p>Next day, I got the call for onsite interviews.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Onsite round by SDE â€“ 1<br /> Q1. Given very large number of empty crates of varying sizes, we need to find the best fit crate for the given item and allocate it. Need to design a data structure for this scenario. Operations involved:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insert a crate</li>
<li>Search the best fit crate</li>
<li>Delete the crate after allocating it.</li>
</ol>
<p>e.g. 3 crates of weight 10, 20 and 30 are there. An item of size 15 appears then weâ€™ll allocate crate of size 20 and delete it.</p>
<p>Sol. Use binary search tree (balanced using red-black criteria or any) and implement ceil function.</p>
<p>All operations will be O (log(n)).</p>
<p>Q2. Optimize above data structure for weekends where amazon have lots of crates but very less search operations.</p>
<p>Q3. Given a function boolisValidWord(string str) you need to check whether a string is a proper string or not. E.g. iloveicecream is valid : I love ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> Manager of some other Team<br /> Deep discussion on projects.<br /> In one project I used EC2 service so he asked me many details and why I preferred EC2 over other possible options.</p>
<p>Buy and sell stock question.<br /> <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stock-buy-sell/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stock-buy-sell/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level/</a><br /> General discussion on virtual memory.</p>
<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> 2 SDE-1s<br /> Q1. Given matrix of 1s and 0s where 0 is water and 1 is land. Find number of islands.</p>
<p>Q2. Give the size of all islands in above question.</p>
<p>Q3. <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/</a></p>
<p><strong>Round 5:</strong> Dev Manager, 6yrs exp. (May be bar raiser round still I am not sure :P)</p>
<p>Q1. We started our discussion for very general problem where we have a long stream of characters and we need to extract all the patters from that stream. There can be integers, fractions, words or anything.</p>
<p>I explained the entire process which is used in lexical analysis phase of compiler design where we give regular expressions and finally they are converted to NFAs and finally a single DFA.</p>
<p>Then a discussion went on how weâ€™ll implement this system from scratch.</p>
<p>There are many algorithms for converting regular expressions to NFAs and finally DFAs and some general discussion over Natural Language Processing.</p>

<p>Q2. Given M sorted linked lists of each of size N, we need to merge them to single linked list of size M x N using no extra space.<br /> Next day I got the call that they would like to extend me the offer for SDE-1 profile.</p>
<p><strong>Important Tips:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare data structures thoroughly.</li>
<li>Less efficient solution is much better than no solution.</li>
<li>Adopt incremental approach for problem solving.</li>
</ol>
