<h1>Amazon Interview | Set 120 (On-Campus for Internship)</h1>
<p>Recently Amazon visited our college and details are as follows. <span id="more-130981"></span></p>
<p><strong>Online Round:</strong><br /> There were two questions.<br /> 1. N strings are given.Convert all string to corresponding decimal value typed in an Alphanumeric Keypad (e.g. “bdg” -&gt; 234). Then print all strings in decreasing order of their decimal value. If they have same decimal value then print lexicographically smaller first.<br /> Input:</p>
<pre><code>5
Amazon
sun
run

Output:
262966  amazon
786 run
786 sun </code></pre>
<p>2. Write a code to print all possible combinations(order matters) of characters of string in lexicographical order.<br /> Input: “ABC”<br /> Output: A, AB, ABC, AC, ACB, B, BA, BAC, BC, BCA, C, CA, CAB, CB, CBA</p>
<p>Interview:<br /> <strong>Round 1: 45 minutes</strong><br /> This started with a brief discussion on project. She quickly moved on to Coding questions.<br /> She made me write an error free code for “Count all pairs which sum to k in a BST”. Also she added that duplicates may be present but on left side only.<br /> First she discussed for approach and then constrained the space complexity to be O(1). She checked the code rigorously.<br /> Then there were 3-4 coding questions. She just discussed approach.<br /> -Update all nodes in a bst to be sum of all elements greater than or equal to it.<br /> – Stock problem/ Given an array ‘arr’ find maximum difference between two elements (max(arr[i]-arr[j]) where i&gt;=j).<br /> -Then there was this awesome question… Given a perfect binary tree.<br /> print nodes in a specific manner. e.g-</p>
<pre><code>             15
            /  \
          13    14
        /  \    /  \
       9   10  11   12
      / \  / \ / \  / \
     1  2  3 4 5 6  7 8
print - 1 8 2 7 3 6 4 5 9 12 10 11 13 14 15 </code></pre>
<p>I told her approaches having some space complexity. Again she restricted space complexity, and I got an efficient solution by recognizing some pattern <img src="media/file10.gif" alt=";)" /> .</p>
<p><strong>Round 2: 25 minutes</strong><br /> There were just two questions.<br /> 1- Given a string having no spaces, and a dictionary.Problem was to find if that string can be splitted in multiple strings such that all the splitted<br /> strings are in dictionary. I was provided a function search(string str) which will tell if a particular string str is in the dictionary or not.<br /> I quickly gave a recursive approach.<br /> 2- The second question was well known vertical order traversal of a binary tree. She just discussed how to implement various approaches in C++.<br /> Then there was discussion on types of projects assigned to Interns and blah blah.</p>
