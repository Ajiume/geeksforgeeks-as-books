Parenthesis pairs are given in a separate list. You have to optimize the problem by suggesting the method you will need to store the pairs.</p>
<p><strong>2nd round: Hiring manager</strong><br /> What is the angle between hour and minute hand at 12:15. I said 90â€™ but corrected myself immediately.</p>
<p>So he told me the importance that for huge no of clients this small mistake can create a blunder.</p>
