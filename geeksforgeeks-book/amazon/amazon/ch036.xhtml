<h1>Amazon Interview | Set 27</h1>
<p>Hi, I was recently interviewed for SDE1 position for Amazon and got selected. I have 1.5 year experience in java. Geeksforgeeks helped me lot. I am very thankful to Geeksforgeeks team. <span id="more-117110"></span>Following were interview questions-</p>
<p>Two telephonic rounds followed by 5 F2F interviews.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1 (Telephonic):</strong></p>
<p>1. There is a dictionary already implemented. Write a method, which takes input String without space, to prints all subsets of the input string which is present in dictionary.</p>
<p>Example: Dictionary â€“ a*<br /> ………….Input- aaabaa<br /> ………….Output- a,a,a,aa,aa,aaa,a,a,aa</p>
<p>2. There is a dictionary already implemented. Write a method , which takes input String without space, to replace the characters from the strings which are not present in dictionary with –</p>
<p>Example: Dictionary â€“ a*<br /> ………….Input- aaabaa<br /> ………….Output- aaa_aa</p>
<p>Interviewer was cool. Did not code properly (lots of bugs were in code), but gave good approach for first question. For second question solution sent in a mail.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2 (Telephonic):</strong></p>
<p>1. Write a program to remove duplicates from array of prime numbers.</p>
<p>2. Write a program to return nearest elements from a binary search tree for input element.</p>
<p>This round was very good. Interviewer was very happy with my approach for both questions. Code did not have big bug.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1 (F2F- Problem Solving and coding):</strong><br /> 1. Tell me about yourself.<br /> 2. Write a program to find top 10 elements on an array of integers.<br /> Donâ€™t remember much. Questions were easy. This round was very good. Interviewer was happy with solution.<br /> 3. Write a program to calculate a^b and store it in floating point representation.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2 (F2F- Computer Fundamental):</strong><br /> 1. Tell me about experience in past job.<br /> 2. OOPS concepts- Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction.<br /> 3. Aggregation and Composition.<br /> 4. Design patterns which you have implemented.<br /> 5. Write code to implement Singleton design pattern.<br /> 6. Design a system to implement options in Pack of cards.<br /> 7. Difference between Windows and Unix.<br /> 8. Threads, Synchronization, Deadlock.<br /> 9. Other subjects which you studied in your academics.<br /> 10. Most challenging work you ever faced.<br /> 11. Discussed about current project, role.<br /> This round was fair enough. I was not able to discuss questions on subjects which I studied in academics.</p>
<p><strong>Round 3 (F2F- Data Structures and Algorithms):</strong><br /> 1. Tell me about yourself.<br /> 2. There is a 2d array. Write code to find the path with maximum sum. You can only traverse i+1 or j+1.if i is row number and j is column number.<br /> I solved it using dynamic programming<br /> 3. In a binary tree find the least common ancestor for two nodes. (Write code)<br /> 4. Similar to 3rd question. Write a program to find least common ancestor in binary search tree.<br /> This round was very good. Finished it only 40 mins.</p>
<p><strong>Round 4 (F2F- Managerial round):</strong><br /> 1. Tell me about yourself.<br /> 2. Copy Linked list with orbit pointer.<br /> 3. Write a code to find top hundred elements in a data set which cannot be loaded in RAM.<br /> 4. Typical parenthesis checking problem.<br /> 5. Most challenging work you ever faced.<br /> 6. What will do if you get task which is ambiguous.<br /> 7. At what extend you will be frustrated if you always get ambiguous problems.<br /> 8. How many members in your team in current organization. Whatâ€™s your role? Questions on current project.</p>
<p>Interviewer was very cool and friendly.</p>
<p><strong>Round 5 (F2F- Bar raiser round):</strong><br /> 1. Tell me about yourself.<br /> 2. Discussed about current project.<br /> 3. Write a program to find number of inversions in an array.<br /> Example- Array 2, 5, 3, 1,10<br /> Inversions (2,1) , (5,1), (3,1), (5,3)<br /> Answer will be – 4<br /> Gave solution of complexity o(nlogn) . Interviewer gave me hint for that.<br /> Hint- Divide and conquer approach.<br /> He asked me to write code which doesn’t have any bug.</p>
