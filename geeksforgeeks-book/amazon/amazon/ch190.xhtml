<h1>Amazon Interview Experience | Set 183 (SDE - New Grad Position)</h1>
<p>Following is my experience. I hope it helps people out there, as I got help from other posts here before my interview.<span id="more-134667"></span></p>
<p>Duration: 4 hours</p>
<p><strong>interviewer #1: 8 am – 9 am</strong></p>
<p>Q1) tell me your interest<br /> -&gt; Big Data<br /> Q2) what’s latest thing you follow in it<br /> -&gt; Apache Spark<br /> Q3) What is it and explain<br /> -&gt; told the standard MapRed and Hadoop vs Spark<br /> Q4) what more features<br /> -&gt; told graph processing and MLLIB<br /> Q5) Actual question starts here, given the binary tree, how will you serialize and deserialize it to the file?<br /> -&gt;<br /> answer1: Serialize =&gt; do in-order traversal and pre-order traversal and write it to a file<br />                Deserialize =&gt; build the binary tree using pre-order and in-order traversal<br />      he was not satisfied, gave me hint of no need to do complex in-order, pre-order thing</p>
<p>answer2: BFS clicked me, told him to do BFS and write to a file level wise<br />              But he found a bug in deserialize method, I changed the serialize method for null values to speial character in file</p>
<p>he was okay with it, and asked me to write a code for it<br /> asked the complexity<br /> told him, was not convinced wholly, then finally told him, was still not<br /> left the room with think over it <img src="media/file6.gif" alt=":(" /></p>
<p><strong>interviewer #2: 9am – 10 am</strong><br /> Q1) bang on target, given 2 timeframes, check if they overlap<br /> -&gt; s1, e1, s2, e2<br />    ep1 = epoch(s1),<br />    ep2<br />    ep3<br />    ep4</p>
<p>   if ep1      return T<br />    return F</p>
<p>Q2) LCA in doubly binary tree !!!<br /> -&gt; I frowned, what is doubly binary tree!!<br />    it’s just every node has access to the parent</p>
<p>but you need to find the LCA and you do not have access to root of tree!<br /> some brainstorm, and I got it<br /> what is time complexity:<br /> worst case: O(n^2) in skewed tree<br /> average case: was not sure, gave me hint, and I told him, was okay</p>
<p>told him the 1st way, was convinced but hinted me the better way<br /> Got his hint, and gave the answer, was satisfied</p>
<p>Q3) given 2 strings, how would you find if they are anagrams of each other<br /> -&gt; solution 1: 2 hash ( was okay but asked the better way)</p>
<p>hinted me that no of characters are limited<br /> solution 2: told him the way of count sort, i.e. use 2 count sort arrays<br /> but he said no need of other array, you can do in single array</p>
<p>told him the way, was satisfied</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer #3:</strong><br /> – started with his long intro<br /> – asked mine, and then stopped me as I was talking at length<br /> – asked me amour my search project<br /> – asked me the basic design<br /> – how did you deal with data when you cannot fit in memory<br /> – how did you do intersection of posting lists<br /> – what is time complexity</p>
<p>then asked me to design the chase game<br /> stumbled like hell, i guess this is going to be my rejection factor</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer #4: (manager) behavioral round</strong><br /> – gave his long intro<br /> – asked about myself<br /> – when did you feel that something could have been done in better way after delivering it in project<br /> – when did you perform best way, as in what did you come up with that other could not do<br /> – when did you go out of the way i.e. against your managers, or higher authority and deliver the best according to you</p>
<p>– asked the system architecture question: design the TINYURL system in terms of server architecture i.e. HA, scalability and request processing</p>
<p>– was satisfied, and left with good note.</p>
