<h1>Second round</h1>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Given two valid dictionary words, find the minimum number of steps required to transform first word to second word. Following are the transformation rules –</p>
<p>1. You can, in a single step, change a single letter in the word.<br /> 2. Each transition should result in a valid word. Assume you have been provided a helper function boolean isValid (String word) which tells you if a word is valid or not.<br /> 3. This must be done with minimum transitions.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Transform CAT to TOY. One of the several possible transformations is CAT -&gt; CAR -&gt; TAR -&gt; TOR -&gt; TOY</p>
<p><strong>Question 2 :</strong> Assume you have been given a binary tree such that the angle between horizontal and the line joining node to it’s left child (or right child) is 45 degree. This essentially means node 5 and 6 in the tree figure above collapse into a single node. A vertical for a tree is defined as shown in the figure below. Given a binary tree of the kind defined above, find the number of verticals that can be drawn.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Refer to the diagram below to get an idea on verticals.<br /> <a href="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/vertical-tree.png"><img src="media/file18.png" alt="vertical-tree" /></a><br /> ?<br /> <strong>Sub questions:</strong><br /> * Provide a solution and also provide a working code for the same.</p>
