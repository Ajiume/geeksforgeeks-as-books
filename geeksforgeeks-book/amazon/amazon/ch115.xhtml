<h1>Amazon Interview | Set 108 (On-Campus)</h1>
<p>Dear, I just got hired by Amazon in my campus placement drive. Below are the details of my selection process with amazon.<span id="more-130633"></span></p>
<p><strong>Fist Round(Online):</strong><br /> 20 MCQ questions and 2 Coding Questions .<br /> Coding Questions :<br /> 1. Merge overlapping intervals(Very well known repeating problem).<br /> 2. Given a singly linked list you have to subtract the value of first node from the last node and so on until you reach the middle node.<br /> Eg: Input: 5 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1<br /> Output: 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1</p>
<p><strong>F2F-1:</strong><br /> 1) Given a sorted circular link list and a pointer to random node, now insert a new node. I did it , but i used if and else for some special cases in my code so he asked me to do it without if else for special cases (generic &amp; simple code ).</p>
<p>2) Given a pointer to node in tree and a root pointer. Print all the nodes which are at a distance k from the given node.</p>
<p><strong>F2F-2:</strong><br /> 1) He gave me task scheduling problem:<br /> Given a set of modules, some modules depend on previous modules and can only be executed, if the requirements of that module is complete.</p>
<pre><code>Eg: module A depends on module B,C
   module B depends on module C and D
   module C depends on E
   module E depends on D
   module D doesn&#39;t depend on any other module </code></pre>
<p>so he asked me to give a schedule for above modules such that when a module is executed then all requirements of that module are complete.<br /> so answer would be D E C B A</p>
<p>2) Given a string of letters from alphabet. Remove all pairs(2 consecutive same character) of characters which occur consecutively.And do it recursively on remaining string.</p>
<pre><code>Eg given string abcdaadhhhhhzppzl
  then output string should be : abchl </code></pre>
<p>Hint: He asked me to use some data structure for it .</p>
<p>3) Given a binary tree set the sibling pointers . I told him that i already know the question so he said code it .</p>
<p>4) He asked me about hashing .<br /> 4.1 He asked me about complexity . I told him about O(logn) and O(1) .<br /> 4.2 Then he asked me about how do you get O(1). I told him my approach . He said how will you rehash it when required . I told him that i will use extra memory and copy the hash map . Then i Optimized and did it in-place using a Boolean field.<br /> 4.3 Then he took this question to OS and asked me to do it using threads .<br /> 4.4 Asked me what all problems you will need to take care about this problem while using threads and give solution to it.</p>
<p>5) Discussion on my projects</p>
<p><strong>F2F-3:</strong><br /> He gave me 3 coding questions :<br /> 1) Given a number n find the number of valid permutations of a string formed using characters ‘(‘ and ‘)’ . A string is valid if it has matching opening and closing parenthesis .<br /> Eg: given n=2 so you can have 2 possible permutations which are valid (()) and ()() .</p>
<p>2) Given a singly link list reverse every 3 nodes and if nodes are less than 3 then reverse them also.</p>
<pre><code>Eg: Input:  1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8
    Output: 3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;6-&gt;5-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;7 </code></pre>
<p>3) Given a string of letters from alphabet insert frequency of each character in the string.</p>
<pre><code>Eg: Input:  aaabbbccdefgggaaa
    Output: a3b3c2d1e1f1g3a3 </code></pre>
<p>Time Complexity Required O(n) Space Complexity Required O(1)</p>
<p><strong>Fourth Round (Bar Raiser):</strong><br /> It was a telephonic round with a collabedit screen shared on our laptops.</p>
<p>1) Tell me something about yourself .</p>
<p>2) He saw that i had given a seminar on cloud computing and sky computing so he started with cloud computing .Then he asked me why didn’t cloud computing exist 15 years ago .</p>
<p>3) What do you understand by 32 bit and 64 bit OS ? . He asked for explanations in terms of hardware and software . Then he asked me that will a 16 bit program run on 64 bit OS without any problem . He asked me what can be the reason for problem faced .</p>
<p>4) What happens when you type www.amazon.in in your browser ? . He asked me for the set of activities that take place during this time . Then he went into asking how do you get to know the IP address of your ISP . Then after a lot of discussion he was satisfied .</p>
<p>5) Some questions about Complexity of a algorithm . Asked me to prove complexity of few sample codes .</p>
<p>6) Some questions about storage space of a variable( data segment , stack , heap , BSS ). Some questions about Macro preprocessors and there problems &amp; solutions .</p>
<p>7) Some questions about error in sample code given (like returning non compatible pointer type or returning address of a local variable etc )</p>
<p>8) In DOS and Linux shell when we press the up arrow we get the recently used commands . He asked me to implement this facility. Then he asked me to do it if memory bound was very tight .</p>
<p>9) This was a question to check my analytic skills . We have customers using www.amazon.in for buying phones. Let say we have a user who visits www.amazon.in for buying mobile phone . He selects a mobile then fills his address details and then when he finally goes for payment then he gets to know that this phone is not available . So how can you improve the over all user experience . Then he asked me that will you suggest redirecting the user to some other site if the product is out of stock .</p>
<p>10) Some HR Questions like What are your areas of your Weaknesses ? What are you doing to improve on them ?</p>
<p>It was an amazing experience. Thanks a lot to GeeksforGeeks for helping me get my dream job <img src="media/file4.gif" alt=":)" /></p>
<p><strong>Suggestions/Tips :</strong><br /> 1) Discuss your approach as many times as possible.<br /> 2) Don’t start Coding the problem until the interviewer asks you to do it.<br /> 3) Tell everything that you are thinking about the problem. They are more interested in knowing how you are approaching the problem.<br /> 4) Asks for hints if you are stuck up. They will help you.<br /> 5) If you don’t know answer to a question then please say it directly. It will save time for other questions.<br /> 6) First be confident about your approach then only code it.</p>
