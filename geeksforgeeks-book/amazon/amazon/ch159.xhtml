<h1>Amazon Interview Experience | Set 151 (For SDE)</h1>
<p><strong>Online Round</strong><br /> 1. Convert Binary tree to linked list.<br /> 2. Rotate a matrix by 90 degree.<span id="more-132803"></span><br /> There were 2 more questions. But I forgot what were they?</p>
<p><strong>Telephonic Interview</strong><br /> Overview of my resume, current role responsibilities and asked to explain internship project in brief.<br /> 1. What is the definition of tree ?<br /> 2. What are the differences between graph and tree?<br /> 3. When can you say a graph to be a tree?<br /> 4. Write a program to show whether a graph is a tree or not using adjacency matrix.<br /> Its always good to ask questions at the end. It shows our interest towards the company.</p>
<p><strong>F2F 1</strong><br /> Overview of current job responsibilities and internship project.<br /> 1. Convert a tree to a sum tree.</p>
<pre><code>Example :
       1                            27
     /   \                        /   \
   2       3     -------&gt;       9      13
  / \     / \                  / \     / \
 4  5    6  7                 0  0    0  0 </code></pre>
<p>Always take care of all the corner cases<br /> 2. Print a pascal tree .<br /> 3. Given a 2D matrix sorted row wise and column wise . Print the matrix in sorted way. (Can be done using Min Heap).<br /> For all the questions, complexity of the program was asked and was being asked to improve both time and space complexity.</p>
<p><strong>F2F 2</strong><br /> Many questions regarding my current project, tools and technology I am working on.<br /> 1. Convert a binary tree to a sum tree . Here he had a new meaning of sum tree.<br /> Example :</p>
<pre><code>Example :
       1                            1
     /   \                        /   \
   2       3     -------&gt;       2      5
  / \     / \                  / \     / \
 4  5    6  7                 4   9   15  22 </code></pre>
<p>(I did it with Level Order Traversal) (Complete working code was required)<br /> 2. Given an array of integers. Find the largest 3 element. (Can be done using Max Heap in less time complexity)</p>
<p><strong>F2F 3</strong><br /> Lots of questions on my current work and tools which I was using.<br /> Why do I want to leave my current company on such a short interval of 5 months.<br /> Why Amazon ?<br /> What inspires you to join Amazon? Why dream company ?<br /> 1. Connect Sibling pointers. I gave a Level Order Traversal solution. He asked to do it in O(1) space complexity. I explained the approach but messed up In writing the working code for that.<br /> 2. Explain the approach of LRU cache and implement using object oriented language.</p>
<p><strong>F2F 4</strong><br /> Why Amazon?<br /> Why do you want to leave your current company in such a short interval?<br /> Did u ask your current company to provide that type of work as u r looking in Amazon?<br /> 1. Design a system for finding the costliest element always whenever we pick up an element from a box.(concept of Max Heap)<br /> 2. A stream of data is coming. Maintain records in a page and mechanism to see previous and next page. (Concept of Doubly Linked List)<br /> (It is always advisable to ask questions in design questions. The interviewers expect that we will be asking questions for clarification)<br /> What is thread?<br /> What is the meaning of memory leakage?<br /> Followed by many OS questions but I forgot.<br /> In every round , after each question , complexity of the algorithm was asked. Its good to ask questions to get more clarification about the question.</p>
<p>I want to thank the entire team of geeksforgeeks. It is a great portal and it helped me a lot in preparing for Amazon interview.</p>
