<h1>Amazon interview Experience | Set 134 (Off-Campus for SDE)</h1>
<p>I would like to start off by thanking the entire community of GeeksforGeeks for helping me out. <span id="more-131741"></span></p>
<p><strong>Attempt 1</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Round1:</strong></span><br /> 1. Given a number N, find the number of correct combination of parentheses possible.</p>
<pre><code>  Input: N=2 =&gt; ()()
  Output: 2 [(()),()()]

  Input: N=3 =&gt; ()()()
  Output: 5 [()()(),((())),(())(),(()()),()(())]</code></pre>
<p>2. Print all root to leaf paths using iterative algorithm in linear time.</p>
<p><span><strong>Round 2:</strong></span><br /> 1. Given â€˜mâ€™ and â€˜nâ€™ (m &lt; n), print all nodes between levels â€˜mâ€™ and â€˜nâ€™ in level order.<br /> 2. Print a matrix in spiral order.</p>
<p><span><strong>Round 3:</strong></span><br /> 1. Check if two trees are mirror images of each other.<br /> 2. Given inorder and preorder traversals, build a binary search tree.<br /> 3. Print all the boundary nodes of a given binary tree.<br /> I was rejected after this round. I applied again after few months.</p>
<p><strong>Attempt 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Written Round(on HackerRank):</strong> It contained 3 simple questions on data structures. Duration 60 mins.</p>
<p><span><strong>F2F – Round 1:</strong></span><br /> 1. Given a singly linked list and a value â€˜kâ€™ such that k Input: A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E , k=2<br /> Output: E -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; A -&gt; B</p>
<p>Input: A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E -&gt; F , k=2<br /> Output: E -&gt; F -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; A -&gt; B</p>
<p>2. What is Paging? What do you mean by page faults? How will you handle page faults?</p>
<p><span><strong>F2F – Round 2:</strong></span><br /> 1. Given a BST and given that 2 nodes are swapped in the tree. Identify the 2 swapped nodes.<br /> 2. Given a BST and 2 nodes. Identify the length between the two nodes of the tree.</p>
<p><span><strong>F2F – Round 3:</strong></span><br /> 1. Detailed discussion of current projects.<br /> 2. How would you design the meeting invite feature of Microsoft Outlook? Considering each meeting invite as an object and that Web server is the storage space for the invites, design a data structure to receive and send invites to user in an efficient manner. The message objects must be received in a sorted manner based on the time of meeting. I gave an O(NlogN) solution and he was pretty impressed. I was then asked to code it.<br /> 3. An array is given whose every ith index is the child node of a[i] as shown in the example below. The root node is represented by -1. Find the height of the tree.I did it in linear time.</p>
<pre><code>Input: parent[] = {1 2 -1 2}
Output: 4
The given array represents following Binary Tree
         2
        /  \
       1    3
      /
     0</code></pre>
<p><span><strong>F2F – Round 4:</strong></span><br /> 1. Cultural info and projects discussion. What errors have you performed in your career path? What are the major challenges that you faced?…and other such questions.<br /> 2. Design a parking lot system. She was very much concerned with all the edge cases.<br /> 3. How would detect whether a singly linked list is a palindrome or not?I gave a solution with O(n) time and space complexity. But she asked to optimize it further with O(1) space complexity.</p>
