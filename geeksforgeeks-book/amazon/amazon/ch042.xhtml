<h1>Amazon Interview | Set 34</h1>
<p>First of all, a very very big thanks to whole team of geeks for geeks. It is because of them only that I was able to crack the interview process of amazon and get a job in my dream company. <span id="more-121481"></span></p>
<p><strong>No of Rounds:</strong> 1 MCQ round + 2 online test round + 4 PI</p>
<p><strong>Type of Interviews:</strong> Campus Interview for freshers</p>
<p><strong>MCQ round(Time) : 45 minutes</strong> 20 Objective Questions:</p>
<p>5 question on maths which included 3 on probability</p>
<p>Some c output questions easily available on <a href="http://geeksquiz.com/">geeks quiz</a></p>
<p>Questions on heap, hashing, time complexity of recursive functions<br /> One sql query, one question on fcfs and round robin scheduling, page fault in demand paging, dining-philosopher problem,one on propositional logic, one based on Huffman code.</p>
<p><strong>Online test 1 (Time): 45 Minutes</strong><br /> 2 Questions:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Given three linked lists,where each linked list represents a number, add the three lists and return the resultant list.<br /> 5-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;NULL<br /> 9-&gt;1-&gt;NULL<br /> 7-&gt;2-&gt;2-&gt;NULL<br /> Output :: 1-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;5-&gt;NULL<br /> <strong>2.</strong> Given an array and two numbers x and y, find minimum distance between two numbers x and y. assume that x and y always exist in array and it may be that x and y are same alsoâ€¦</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Online test 2 (Time): 45 Minutes</strong><br /> <strong>1.</strong> Convert a given binary tree to sum tree.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Given an array consisting of both positive and negative numbers, 0 is considered as positive, rearrange the elements such that positive and negative numbers are placed alternatively, constraints are that it should be in-place and order of elements should not change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Interview Round 1(75 Minutes):</strong><br /> Technical Interview<br /> Asked to give a brief idea about my project.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Given a linked list,reverse every k nodes of the linked list.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> given a matrix of size m * n, place k students in such a way so that cheating in an exam could be minimizedâ€¦. Was asked to just explain the approach, no code required.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> suppose a online chat between customer and serviceman, serviceman wants to reply to customer as soon as possibleâ€¦suppose text which is to be sent as reply takes 10 sec for being typed. How can he make typing faster ?<br /> My answer was using autoprediction feature, by which he will need to type less number of characters, so typing will become faster..<br /> Then question was extended to how to store the words for being used in predictionâ€¦<br /> I answered a trie data structure which allows prefix matching..<br /> Then question was further extended to write a code to traverse all the words stored in dictionary in lexicographic order..</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Interview Round 2(50-60 Minutes):</strong><br /> Technical Interview<br /> First of all was asked to tell something about myself.<br /> Then a detailed discussion about the project, conversation continued nearly for 20 minutes, he wanted me to explain him everything from the scratch.. I used genetic algorithm in my project..so he wanted to explain him the concept of genetic algorithm..<br /> Then a coding question:: stable stock problem.<br /> You are given prices of stock of a company at consecutive days in an array..write a code to find the maximum profit one can make by keeping a stock value for as long as possible..that value of a stock is called a stable stock value.<br /> Example::<br /> 6 5 9 8 3<br /> So maximum profit is 15, because stock of value 5 would be hold for 3 days. So max profit is 15.<br /> The problem basically was a variation of finding index of next smaller element.<br /> I solved it using the concept of largest rectangular area in a histogram where need to keep track of previous smaller will not be required.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Interview Round 3(60-75 Minutes): (Bar Raiser Round)</strong><br /> Technical Interview<br /> Interviewer was very cool.. he first asked about me, did some casual talk to do away with my nervousness.<br /> Infact, he told me that it looks like that you all have studied geeks for geeks very thoroughly so I am going to ask you a question that is not present in geeks for geeks. He challenged me it will be a question you have not heard of before. At the end of round, he showed me it was a question from top coder, but I had never heard of anything called top coder before.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Given a string, find the longest sinusoidal sequence in it. If there are multiple such sequences of same maximum length, return the one which comes first in lexicographic order in a dictionary..<br /> Sinusoidal means increasing then decreasing then increasing and so on.<br /> Example ::<br /> a r u n ::<br /> a u n , a r n , r u n are three such sequences of length 3â€¦. But, a r n is output since it comes first in lexicographic order.<br /> Interviewer gave me hints that if I had to found the sequence in which all elements were increasing, then I answered LIS will give me the solution , this was the hint. So, basically, it was a variation of LIS. I answered it in O(n2) and 2n spaceâ€¦.<br /> Then was asked to do it in (n) space and o(n).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Suppose a student needs to implement a bst structure to solve a problem, but instead he used a linked listâ€¦. Then give an example of input sequence, in which his implementation worksâ€¦ new value will always be added at beginning of a linked list.. so. Basically at each step after insertion , root of bst and head of link list should point to same node. I was asked to provide the sequence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Interview Round 4( 35 Minutes)</strong><br /> This round started of with some nontechnical questions.. what will I do in different situations?<br /> They seemed to have found out every detail of terms involved in my project..so, there was a detailed discussion on projectâ€¦ my project involved concepts of statistics, so he asked me questions regarding statsâ€¦. This discussion went nearly for half an hourâ€¦. In the end, he told me lets see whether your project could bring you to amazonâ€¦.<br /> After the 4th round, I nearly have to wait for 4 hours before the result were announced. Finally, the interviewer said they were highly impressed by me and I was hired.<br /> In total 7 students were selected among us.<br /> Once again a big thanks to whole geeksforgeeks team.</p>
