<h1>Amazon Interview | Set 119 (On-Campus for Internship)</h1>
<p>The selection procedure consisted of an online round followed by two Personal Interviews.<span id="more-130949"></span></p>
<p><strong>Online Round:</strong><br /> The first round had 20 mcq consisting of 3-4 questions from aptitude, 2 questions from os and rest were from Basic C and Data Structure. There were 2 coding questions as well.</p>
<p>Question 1: You are given a phone keypad like following diagram, where each character corresponds to a digit mentioned in the same box.<br /> <img src="media/file13.png" /></p>
<p>You are given n strings and you have to find their decimal representation. You have to print the string and corresponding decimal representation in descending order.<br /> Like if you are given â€œamazonâ€? then its corresponding decimal notation will be 262966.<br /> If more than one strings have same decimal notation then you have to print them in the order in which input is given.<br /> (Given that given string consists of lower case alphabets only.)</p>
<pre><code>Test Case 1:
5
Amazon
Microsoft
Facebook
Aa
Bb

Output:
642767638  microsoft
32232665  facebook
262966  amazon
22 aa
22 bb </code></pre>
<p>Question 2: Given a string. Print all Possible permutations of different lengths in sorted order.</p>
<pre><code>Input: abc
Output:
A
Ab
Ac
Abc
b
Bc
c </code></pre>
<p>Candidate who could solve at least one question out of 2 coding questions was selected for personal Interviews.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2(P.I. 1) :-</strong><br /> Firstly interviewer had a deep discussion of my project. He also asked me to write code for one of my mini project (Backtracking).<br /> Then he asked two back to back coding questions â€“</p>
<p>1. You are given a bst. You have to print the kth smallest element.<br /> (<a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst-order-statistics-in-bst/" class="uri">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst-order-statistics-in-bst/</a>).</p>
<p>2. You are given two sorted arrays and you have to print the median obtained after merging them in log(n) time complexity.<br /> (<a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst-order-statistics-in-bst/">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/</a>)<br /> Then he asked the language in which I am comfortable for coding. I said C . Then he asked me to allocate the dynamic memory of 2-d array in C( I used malloc function for this). Then he asked me the difference b/w malloc and new (c++) function.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2 (P.I. 2):-</strong><br /> Firstly he asked me to tell about my academic background. Then he directly put a coding question in front of me.<br /> 1. You are given a binary tree and two nodes. You have to print the horizontal distance between them.</p>
<p>Let us say :<br /> Given nodes are B and C : Answer would be 2.<br /> Given nodes are A and E : Answer would be 0.<br /> Given nodes are D and G : Answer would be 4.</p>
<p>We had an long discussion of 45 mins (approx.) on this problem.</p>
<p>One of my friend was asked the following questions:<br /> 2. Given a linked list. You have to determine whether or not it is a palindrome in order O(n) time without using auxiliary space.<br /> 3. You are given an array of integers . You have to find the maximum sum sequence.(It needs not be contiguous).</p>
<p>After all these rounds I and my friend both were selected <img src="media/file4.gif" alt=":)" /> :). A total of 16 candidates were selected.<br /> I really thank to GEEKSFORGEEKS for all the support and help in my preparation.</p>
